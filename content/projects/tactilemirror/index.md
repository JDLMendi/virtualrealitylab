We mapped vibrations experienced by the fingertip to the wrist via an optimised function to generate frequencies in the range of 100-Hz to 800-Hz, which best activate the rapidly adapting mechano-receptors in the wrist. The signal is sent to two actuators positioned on the wrist. The actuators activate in a temporal order according to the direction of finger movement on the surface.
