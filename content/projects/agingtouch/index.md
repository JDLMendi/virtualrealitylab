This research project is a collaboration between the Universities of Birmingham and Nottingham, alongside Procter & Gamble, to investigate how tactile, auditory, and visual cues are integrated to perceive surface textures, and how multisensory perception changes with age. Utilising behavioural studies, brain imaging, and modelling, the project aims to understand changes in touch perception in ageing populations, with practical applications in consumer product testing, particularly assessing the tactile quality of cleanliness in dishwashing.
