We describe how to build and use a cheap and simple device to present haptic stimuli to participants. The device can be either used to present objects to participants in the lab, it could be mailed to participantsâ€™ homes with instructions on how to run the experiment or employed it in conjunction with a VR headset to create visual-haptic discrepancies between the object shape or its material properties.
