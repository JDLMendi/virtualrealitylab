        # VR Lab Activities  
        The goal of the lab is to serve as a hub for research, development, and training in virtual, augmented, and mixed reality (VR/AR/MR).  
        ## Supporting BhamXR  
        The lab is an active contributor to **BhamXR**, the University’s interdisciplinary community of over 100 academics engaged in extended reality (XR) research. Our activities include:  
        - **Technical Support**: Providing access to advanced VR hardware and tools to enable pioneering research.  
        - **Workshops and Events**: Hosting seminars, hackathons, and interactive sessions to foster knowledge exchange.  
        - **Collaborative Projects**: Partnering with BhamXR members to develop XR solutions for diverse fields like education, healthcare, and the arts.  
         
         <p>
         To sign up to the BhamXR mailing list and be kept in the loop about VR, MR, AR activities at UoB, Staff and Students can email majordomo@lists.bham.ac.uk with the text: “subscribe bhamxr”
