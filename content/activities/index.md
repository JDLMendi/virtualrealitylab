        # VR Lab Activities  

		The goal of the lab is to serve as a hub for research, development, and training in virtual, augmented, and mixed reality (VR/AR/MR).  

		## Supporting BhamXR  
		The lab is an active contributor to **BhamXR**, the Universityâ€™s interdisciplinary community of over 100 academics engaged in extended reality (XR) research. Our activities include:  
		- **Technical Support**: Providing access to advanced VR hardware and tools to enable pioneering research.  
		- **Workshops and Events**: Hosting seminars, hackathons, and interactive sessions to foster knowledge exchange.  
		- **Collaborative Projects**: Partnering with BhamXR members to develop XR solutions for diverse fields like education, healthcare, and the arts.  
		
		## Empowering the UoB VR Student Society  
		We proudly support the **University of Birmingham VR Student Society**, a student-led initiative promoting XR technologies. Our contributions include:  
		- **Training and Mentorship**: Organizing practical training sessions and offering expert guidance to build XR development skills.
