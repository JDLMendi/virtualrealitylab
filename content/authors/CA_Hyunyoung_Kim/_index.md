I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham. I am interested in providing tools for everyone to fabricate interactive objects for their unique problems. My research method encompasses developing fabrication tools, proposing novel applications such as shape-changing interfaces using on the tools, and conducting user studies to identify usability problems of the tools. I have experience both in academia and industry, focusing on HCI and UX design. I have a strong academic record since my PhD, publishing full papers at CHI and UIST. I am also supervising three PhD students and actively involved academic communities. I have been working in five different countries (UK, Denmark, France, Germany, and South Korea), broadening my research skills and network.
