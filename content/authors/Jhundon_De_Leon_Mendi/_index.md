Hey there! I am a final year student studying BSc Computer Science and an avid user of Virtual Reality.

As a final year, my project focuses on creating a simulation to test 3D interception through utilising and evaluating the Pupil Lab Core HMD binocular eye-tracking addon with the addition of aiding in the creation inbuilt eye-tracking tests at the VR-Lab.

My main interest looks at why VR can be used as a tool in research to understand why and how human behaviour can be influenced based on perception and using eye-tracking technologies. Because of my background in Computer Science, my other interest includes Human-Computer Interaction, Robotics, Extended Realities, and Programming. I am currently one of the student representatives and ambassador for the School of Computer Science. As well as the current chair for the Virtual Reality Society (UBVR) to help create a platform for XR enthusiasts to come together and collaborate.
