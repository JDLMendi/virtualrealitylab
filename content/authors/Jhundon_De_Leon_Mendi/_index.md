**Jhundon** is a BSc Computer Science student with a passion for Virtual Reality (VR). 

His final year project focuses on creating a **framework to test eye-tracking within VR** by developing a simulation to measure the quality of data in 3D interception tasks. His project also aims to aid in the creation of inbuilt eye-tracking tests at the VR-Lab, emphasising accuracy and hardware performance.

His interests extend beyond his project into Human-Computer Interaction, Robotics, Extended Realities, and Programming. He actively contributes to the academic community as a student representative and ambassador for the School of Computer Science. Furthermore, Jhundon serves as the chair for the [Virtual Reality Society (UBVR)](https://www.guildofstudents.com/organisation/ubvr/) for the 2023/24 and 2024/25 academic years. In this role, he aims to fosters a collaborative environment for XR enthusiasts, developing resources and opportunities for students to engage in this cutting-edge field.

In the upcoming year, Jhundon will pursue a master's degree in Cognitive Neuroimaging and Data Science through the Computational Pathway at the School of Psychology. He intends to continue his work with the [VR Lab](https://virtualrealitylab.netlify.app/) and the [Collaborative Teaching Laboratory](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/facilities/collaborative-teaching-laboratory/ctl), further exploring the intersection of VR technology and human behavior. Jhundonâ€™s goals is driven by his curiosity about how VR can be leveraged as a tool to understand and influence human behavior based on controlled virtual environments.
