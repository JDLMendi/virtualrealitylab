Hi! I’m a current master’s student in psychology, and use virtual reality in my dissertation project. My research is focused on the influence of psychosocial factors on perceived stress in a Martian environment, and what it means for future selection processes for space travel. My other research interests include human factors engineering, human-robotics interactions, climate anxiety, and space psychology/medicine. Aside from my degree, I’m a student representative and ambassador for the psychology department, a lead ambassador for the British Psychological Society, and Chair of the UoB Astronomical Society. I hope to utilise the skills I have learnt from these roles and my project in the hope of one day becoming a professor and human performance specialist.
