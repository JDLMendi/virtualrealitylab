2024 Chair of Computer Science, University of Birmingham, UK.

My research is in the areas of HCI, particularly using sensing and environment understanding, Mixed reality, and the use of technology to make collaboration easier and more inclusive.


2023 Computer Vision Specialist, Data Blanket - Leading the vision/AI development of real-time AI-Driven Fire Fighting.

Wildfires result in the loss of thousands of lives, millions of acres, hundreds of billions of dollars in damage, and over 5% of global emissions every year. Doing better should be everybody’s business ‍We just made it ours by building the most comprehensive system out there, empowering our firefighters with new tactical tools and information, and ensuring every part of this fighting system performs better.

2011-2023 Principal Researcher & Research Manager, Microsoft Research

My research focused on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), sensing, and Mixed-Reality displays (MR) to enable users to reach their full potential in productivity, creativity, and collaboration. I have been granted more than 110 patents and published over 90 academic publications (with more than 14000 citations), and I was awarded a senior member of the Assoc. for Computing Machines (ACM).

In addition to publications and the transfer of technology to products, I have released multiple tools and open-source libraries, such as the RoomAlive Toolkit, used around the world for multi-projection systems, SeeingVR to enhance the use of VR for people with low vision, Microsoft Rocketbox avatars, MoveBox and HeadBox toolkits to democratize avatar animation, and RemoteLab for distributed user studies.

Besides my work at Microsoft Research, I served on multiple conference committees and was the paper chair of ACM SIGSPATIAL 2011. I was the Specialty Chief Editor of Frontiers in Virtual Reality for the area of Haptics and on the editorial board of IEEE Computer Graphics and Application Journal (CG&A). I received a senior membership of the ACM.

I have formed and led a new MR research group at Microsoft Research’s Extreme Computing lab. I envision MR applications as weaved with the fabric of our lives rather than PC and mobile apps, limited to running on a specific device’s screen. Such applications must be smart enough to understand users’ changing physical and social contexts and flexible enough to adapt accordingly. We developed systems such as FLARE (Fast Layout for AR experiences) that were used by the HoloLens Team and inspired the Unity MARS product, or Triton 3D audio simulation used by Microsoft Games such as Gears of War 4 and is the base of Microsoft Acoustics. ILLUMIROOM, a collaboration with the Redmond Lab, was presented at CES 2013 Keynote.


2005-2011 Research Manager, Bing, Microsoft

I formed Microsoft's Bing Maps & Mobile Research Lab. We combined generated many novel results, impacting the product while generating world-class computer vision and graphics research. Among our results is the development of the influential text detector technology used by the Bing Mobile app and incorporated into OpenCV, the world’s first street-side imagery service, street-level reconstruction of geometry and texture pipeline, novel texture compression used by Virtual Earth 3D, and more.

Besides publishing in leading computer vision and graphics forums, our work was presented at TED 2010 and in the New York Times.


I was a founder of several startup companies. 
Among them, a develop of a very succesful 2D+3D graphic editor for the Amiga computer, development of a novel game engine rendering global illumination effects in real-time, and overseeing software R&D of the world’s first time-of-flight video camera in a startup company. I used cameras for applications such as TV depth keying and reconstruction, and it was the basis for the Depth cameras used by Microsoft HoloLens and Magic Leap HMD.
